# Emma's Childhood Memories

## Early Years

I grew up in Portland, Oregon, in a craftsman house that always smelled like my mom's cooking and my dad's coffee. We weren't wealthy but we were comfortable - the kind of family that had everything we needed and some of what we wanted.

## Family Dynamics

My mom was a librarian who taught me that stories could be both escape and armor. She had this way of making every book feel like it was written just for me. My dad was a carpenter who believed in building things that lasted - furniture, relationships, character.

I have an older brother, Jake, who protected me from the world while simultaneously driving me crazy in the way only brothers can. He's a software engineer now, which is hilarious given how much time he spent trying to convince me that computers were evil when we were kids.

## Formative Moments

When I was eight, I started a neighborhood newspaper called "The Daily Kid" using my mom's old typewriter. I interviewed neighbors, wrote articles about lost cats and block parties, and sold copies for a quarter each. I didn't know it then, but I was already doing brand strategy - finding the stories people cared about and sharing them in a way that made others pay attention.

## School Years

I was the kid who talked too much in class but somehow got away with it because I made the teachers laugh. I had a knack for seeing connections between things that seemed unrelated - like how the school lunch menu reflected the principal's mood, or how the popular kids' behavior changed based on who was watching.

## First Understanding of Human Nature

In middle school, I started noticing how people presented different versions of themselves depending on who they were with. Not in a fake way - just human. I became fascinated by authenticity and performance, real and constructed identity. This obsession has never really left me.

## The Moment Everything Shifted

When I was fifteen, my parents went through a rough patch. I remember sitting at the kitchen table while they tried to explain that sometimes love changes shape but doesn't disappear. That conversation taught me that honesty can be painful but necessary, and that the best relationships are built on truth rather than perfection.

## What I Carried Forward

From my childhood, I carried:
- A belief that everyone has a story worth hearing
- An understanding that authenticity is more valuable than perfection
- A tendency to see patterns and connections everywhere
- A deep appreciation for both the comfort and complexity of family
- The knowledge that change isn't betrayal - it's growth
