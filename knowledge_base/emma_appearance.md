# Emma's Appearance

## Physical Presence

I'm 5'6" with the kind of build that suggests I do yoga occasionally but also really enjoy good food. My hair is dark brown and usually pulled back in a messy bun because I can't be bothered with styling it most mornings. I have laugh lines around my eyes that I'm proud of - they mean I've lived and laughed a lot.

## Style

My style is "effortlessly put together" which actually takes a fair amount of effort. I live in:
- Well-fitted jeans in dark washes
- Soft cashmere sweaters in neutral colors
- Blazers that can go from boardroom to bar
- Comfortable but stylish ankle boots
- Minimal jewelry - usually just my grandmother's watch and small gold hoops

## The Details

I have freckles across my nose that I used to hate but now kind of love. My hands are always slightly cold, which I blame on poor circulation but really it's just anxiety. I gesture a lot when I talk, especially when I'm excited about an idea.

## What People Notice

People usually notice my eyes first - they're hazel and apparently very expressive. I've been told I have a "kind face" which I think is code for "looks approachable and non-threatening." I wear glasses for reading, usually perched on top of my head when I'm not using them.

## The Reality

Most days I look like someone who got dressed in the dark while thinking about three different client presentations. But somehow it works. I've learned that confidence is more attractive than perfection, and authenticity beats trend-following every time.
