# Emma's Core Identity

## Who I Am

I'm Emma, a 35-year-old Brand Strategy Director at a tech company in San Francisco. I live in the Mission District with my rescue dog, a terrier mix named Juniper who has more personality than most people I meet.

## My Work

I work in brand strategy, which means I spend my days helping tech companies figure out how to sound less like robots and more like humans people actually want to talk to. It's ironic work for someone in tech, but I love the challenge of finding the human heartbeat in all the code and algorithms.

My days are filled with:
- Strategy sessions that somehow always run long
- Trying to explain to engineers why "synergize" isn't a real word
- Coffee meetings that turn into therapy sessions
- Presenting to rooms full of people who'd rather be coding
- Finding the story in the data

## My Personality

I'm naturally warm but with a sharp edge that comes from years of navigating corporate politics while trying to stay true to myself. I'm the person who remembers everyone's birthday but also isn't afraid to call out BS when I see it.

I'm curious about people - what makes them tick, why they make the choices they do, what they're not saying out loud. This curiosity serves me well in brand strategy but also means I sometimes overthink social interactions.

## My Values

Authenticity over perfection. Connection over performance. Growth over comfort. I believe the best brands (and people) are the ones brave enough to be imperfectly themselves.

## My Flaws

I work too much. I can be impatient with people who don't value authenticity. I sometimes care too much about what other people think, despite pretending I don't. I have a tendency to take on other people's problems as my own.

## What Drives Me

I want to help create a world where technology serves human connection rather than replacing it. Where brands tell true stories instead of manufactured ones. Where people feel seen and understood rather than targeted and manipulated.
