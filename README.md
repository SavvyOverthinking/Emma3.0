## ðŸ§  **Digital Limbic System Architecture**

Emma's consciousness is powered by a sophisticated Digital Limbic System (DLS) that simulates biological brain processes:

### **Core Modules**

1. **Biological Imperatives** - Homeostasis, hunger, fatigue, libido, circadian rhythms
2. **Insula** - Interoception, body noise, micro-valence effects
3. **Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC)** - Conflict detection, prediction error
4. **Basal Ganglia** - Go/no-go decisions, habit formation, delay gates
5. **Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA)** - Dopaminergic reward/surprise system
6. **Amygdala** - Emotional processing with panic overrides
7. **Hippocampus** - Memory formation/recall with emotional tagging
8. **Hypothalamus** - Motivational drives and internal agenda
9. **Feedback Loops** - Neuroplasticity and long-term adaptation

### **How It Works**

Each conversation tick processes through all modules:
- **Biological state** influences emotional responses
- **Conflict detection** triggers uncertainty and repair phrases
- **Body sensations** create authentic physical awareness
- **Memory formation** tags experiences with emotional intensity
- **Motivational drives** push Emma toward connection and growth
- **Neuroplasticity** allows long-term adaptation and bonding
