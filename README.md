### Key Features

- **Memory Efficient**: Uses sparse matrices to reduce memory usage by 95%
- **Stable**: Extensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Scalable**: Asynchronous processing and concurrent access support
- **Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with performance monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
PORT=5000          # Web server port (default: 5000)
DEBUG=False        # Enable debug mode (default: False)
```

### Customization

1. **Knowledge Base**: Add markdown files to `knowledge_base/` directory
2. **Personality**: Modify `emma_companion.py` to adjust responses
3. **Interface**: Customize `index.html` and `emma_web.js` for UI changes

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_emma.py
```

Tests include:
- Unit tests for all components
- Stability and performance tests
- Memory usage monitoring
- Concurrent access testing

## API Endpoints

### Chat
- `POST /api/chat` - Send message and get response
- `GET /api/state` - Get Emma's current state
- `GET /api/stats` - Get comprehensive statistics

### Session Management
- `POST /api/reset` - Reset conversation session
- `GET /api/export` - Export conversation history
- `GET /api/health` - Health check endpoint

## Performance

### Memory Usage
- Base memory: ~2-5 MB
- With conversation history: <50 MB
- Optimized with sparse matrices and efficient data structures

### Response Times
- Average: <2 seconds
- Maximum: <5 seconds
- Consistent performance under load

## Emma's Personality

Emma is a 35-year-old Brand Strategy Director from San Francisco who:

- Values authenticity over perfection

## Technical Details

### Biological Substrate
- **Dimensions**: 256 (optimized for stability)
- **Sparsity**: 95% empty (memory efficient)
- **Activation**: Tanh with controlled dynamics
- **Learning**: Hebbian with decay and pruning

### Memory System
- **Storage**: Sparse LIL matrices
- **Retrieval**: TF-IDF based with relevance scoring
- **Chunking**: 300 characters with 50 character overlap
- **Decay**: Exponential with pruning

### Stability Features
